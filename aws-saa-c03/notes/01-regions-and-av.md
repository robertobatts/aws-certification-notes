# AWS Regions and Availability Zones


## Regions
-   A region is a cluster of data centers
-   Most AWS services are region scoped

### How to choose a Region?
-   **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements
-   **Proximity** to customers to reduce latency
-   **Available services**, new services aren’t available in every region
-   **Pricing**

## Availability Zones
-   Each region has many availability zones (e.g. ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c)
-   Each availability zone is composed of one or more data centers
-   They’re physically separated from each other so that they’re isolated from disaster
